The content for this website comes from an old N64 game called Perfect Dark. It's a spy game, and there is an evil mega corporation antagonist in the game. I wanted to focus on something I always found neat and had nostalgia for, and something that I could liken to a massive tech company like Microsoft or Apple. So the idea is to create dataDyne's fake customer landing site where they feature their latest products. 

I first started without having much of a plan, to see what I could piece together. I soon realized I didn't have a great grasp on the flow of a project, and all of the nuances of selectors (specificity). I tried to remember everything we learned in class and I am glad I took notes. I have trimmed my main repo down quite a bit instead of uploading a bunch of assets I was not sure how I was going to use at first.

I will be trying to rebuild the site using gradients on the artwork that fade in and out when you hover on them. I will also try to build a clean navigation menu that collapses down when the window is reduced. I want to try importing some fonts from google, if possible. Furthermore, I will be attempting a parallax effect on one of the product pages once I have a working, passable project. Possibly more features if I have time. Here we go.
