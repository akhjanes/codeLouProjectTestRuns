# dataDyne
Website for dataDyne Corp. (Code Lou)
Asset Links / Credits Bottom of Page.
 


The idea for this website is from an old N64 game called Perfect Dark. It is the website of a fictional corporation called dataDyne. They are the antagonists in the story and use really cool technology. I wanted it to feel like the 'Apple' of big military tech, in the future.  

I first started without having much of a plan, to see what I could piece together. I soon realized I didn't have a great grasp on the flow of a project, and all of the nuances of selectors (specificity). I tried to remember everything we learned in class (glad I took notes!). My first commits are totally bloated and experimental at best. Once I had a good grasp on what I was doing, and the ideas I wanted to implement, things started to come together a lot better. Early on, I implemented a variable and script to make a hamburger icon for the left side menu. 

I will be using a lot of gradiants, and one of my CSS features will be animations / transitions on some navigational links, if that counts. I will also try to implement a parallax effect on at least one page. I will also be trying to implement flex-boxes and media queries that adjust for mobile / desktop.
